pricelistMidTier = {Palis_Crystal = 10} --this is the list of items that are somewhat hard to get, either requiring a machine or convoluted crafting process. These are more expensive to be able to limit early game players from having these.
pricelistHighTier = {Demonic_Slate = 100} --this is the list of item that are hard to get. Requiring high end stuff from certain mods. Lots of time and effort needs to be put in to get this item from scratch. These should be near impossible to get for early game players and hard to get, but still doable, for mid game players.. ofc, easy for end game players.
pricelistInsaneTier = {Dirt = 9000.01} --this is the list of items that are insane. Requiring loads of crafting steps (lots of ae2 automation), convoluted rituals that are hard to automate, etc. These items should be really limited, requiring mid game players to put in a lot of effort to get them, ofcourse end game players can buy them pretty easily... but you know... what can't they buy.
